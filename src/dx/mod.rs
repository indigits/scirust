#![doc="Data exchange

This module and its submodules isizeend to provide
functions for exchanging scientific data in different
formats.

Initial targets are:

* HDF (Hierarchical Data Format)
* MAT (MATLAB format)


# Remarks

At the moment, the graphics capabilities 
do not exist within SciRust. In order
to create graphics, one needs to write
data generated in a SciRust program
and save it in a suitable format 
so that it can be imported in systems like
SciPy etc. The graphics facilities of those
systems can then be used.
